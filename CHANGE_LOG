Change log:

"0.1.4" - Debug statements return strings which you can pass into a logger.

"0.1.5" - Performance improvement - printing a stack trace of length 0 makes no call to Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace.

"0.1.6" - Added traceCode, assertCode as an alternative to traceExpression, assertExpression.

"0.1.7" - Added traceContents for List, Map, etc.

"0.1.8" - Backwards compatibility to scalaVersions "2.10.4" (exception during macro expansion occurs in traceExpression and traceCode in 2.10.4).

"0.1.9" - Reformatted to allow separate imports for prints, traces, and asserts.

"0.2.0" - Added master shutoff switch. (foo).assertEqual(bar) can take two different types.

"0.2.1" - Fixed exception during macro expansion in traceExpression and traceCode in 2.10.4
        - Added jar file names to stacktrace in assertions. Ex. [scalatest_2.11-2.2.6.jar]
        - Enhanced container printing. Example: Debug.traceContents(List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), start = 2, numElements = 3) -> "List[Int] 2 3 4"

"0.2.2" - Added jar file name to traces as well.

"0.2.3" - Added logger integration, "find" method

"0.2.4" - Added package names from LogBack. See (/home/johnreed/sbtProjects/debug/experimental/experimental/src/main/java/info/collaboration_station/debug/internal/PackagingDataCalculator.java)
